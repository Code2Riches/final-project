# Final Project: Game of Thrones - Chess

In this project, you'll see a basic Chess game which allows you to move the individual pieces.

The Game of Thrones theme was added for aesthetic appeal. 

## Requirements

This project meets the requirements as outlined below:
* At least three distinct "features": 1. Chess board skeleton creation with a grid. 2. Alternating Colors of the Chessboard squares with For loops + If/Else If logic. 3. Movement of the Chess pieces within the Chess board. 4. Movement of the Chess pieces into the "Graveyard" once the piece has been taken by the opponent.
* This project contains a `README.md` file that explains what the project is and how to use it
* The project is hosted on GitHub pages
* The code is clean... "Some are saying it's the cleanest code they're ever seen... And these are very smart people" (lol)
  * Proper formating
  * No unnecessary repetition - very efficient
  * Variables as camelCase

## Recommendations

* Start out by creating your project's foundation in HTML.
* Frequently make commmits in git to save your progress.
* Build one piece of Javascript functionality at a time, testing each change you make with `console.log`. 
* Keep your code meticulously organized as you go. 
* Use proper indentation, whitespace, and comments. 
* Try to write a function for each separate piece of functionality that exists in your code. This will make your code "modular" and easier to build off of.
* If you find yourself repeating code, think about how you could use either a loop or a new function to eliminate the repitition. DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself!

Summary:

 GOT Chess has been a great learning experience!
Going forward, I'd make sure to map out the project in more detail prior to jumping in to start coding.
 
I feel there is good mix of HTML, CSS & JS that come together tp create the project as a whole. The intent is to add to this project now that I've        established a foundation/basic set-up for the game. Currently, there is minimal functionality available to the user aside from moving hte chess pieces. There is opportunity to expand on the current code, to add legal moves for each of the pieces, player 1/2 indicators, game timer and much more. Due to time contraints, it will remain as is for now...
